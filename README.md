At Yeshiva University we are given a specific time that we can register for classes. Seniors are able to register first, then Juniors, then sophomores etc.
By the time sophomores or freshmen can register many classes only have one or two slots left, which many students are trying to get into. In order to get into those classes you have to register at the first possible moment, and if you are a few seconds too late you may miss your opportunity.
The program allows you to register the firsts second you are able to, so you will not be locked out of classes due to registering late.
In order to run this program you must download the .exe file and .py file and have all the python dependencies installed.
